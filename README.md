## ✨ Features

DevKit CLI is packed with powerful commands, organized into core workflows and optional helper utilities to automate your development and deployment processes.

### 🚀 Core Automation Commands (Primary)

Your everyday essentials — the main commands that do the heavy lifting:

- **⚙️ devkit-pc-setup**  
  Complete macOS development environment setup: installs tools like Homebrew, Python, Node.js, Flutter, Docker, GCP SDK, and more.
- **🔄 devkit-pc-update**  
  One command to update system apps and dev tools: brew, Python packages, Node.js, Flutter, Docker, GCP SDK, and App Store apps.
- **☁️ gcloud-project-django-setup**  
  Deploy your Django project to Google Cloud Platform using environment variables. Builds, provisions, and deploys your cloud services in one step.
- **🚢 gcloud-project-django-update**  
  Push updates to your Django app on GCP. Rebuilds containers, syncs cloud resources, and applies migrations seamlessly.
- **🗑️ gcloud-project-django-teardown**  
  Cleanly tears down your Django cloud environment. Deletes Cloud Run services, databases, buckets, and all associated GCP resources.

### 🧩 Helper Utilities (Optional, On-Demand)

Extra tools to make your development flow smoother. Use them when you need them!

- **🖥️ System Utilities**
  Network diagnostics, flush DNS, restart Mac, clean up cache, and more quick system commands.
- **🍺 Homebrew & Package Management**
  Install, update, and clean up brew packages. Back up and restore your development package list.
- **🧩 Git & GitHub Shortcuts**
  Configure Git, manage SSH keys, sync branches, push tags, and automate repository tasks.

## 🚀 Installation Steps

- **🔧 Requirements**
  - macOS
  - Zsh shell
  - Git
  - Internet access (for installs and updates)

Install DevKit by cloning the repository and running the installer:

- **1. Clone the repository to your Mac (e.g., into ~/devkit)**

  - ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YDA93/devkit.git ~/devkit
    ```

- **2. Run the installer script**

  - ```bash
    cd ~/devkit
    zsh install.zsh
    ```

This will set up DevKit on your system. The installer may prompt you for some info (like your name, email, and preferences) and then install all necessary tools.  
Once the installer finishes, DevKit’s commands will be available in your shell (you might need to open a new terminal session or source your shell config if instructed). Now you’re ready to use the DevKit CLI.
